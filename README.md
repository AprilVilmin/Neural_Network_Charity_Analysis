# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis and Deep Learning Models

## Overview of Project
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, has a data scientist named Becks. Their specialty is aiding companies who want to help the world, the environment and the people in it. Alphabet Soup has raised billions of dollars. Beck collects data to ensure that it is being used in the most effective and efficient ways possible. Some organizations have proven not to be trustworthy, and this is why Becks has been tasked with identifying which organizations have risks that outweigh the benefits. Becks has decided that the best way to do this is creating and training a learning neural network. This network will use the Python TensorFlow library and will help Alphabet Soup make decisions into the future.
